## **PROCEDURE**:  
1.Design the common source amplfier circuit as per the circuit diagram using LTspice.  
2.Right click on power supply and set gate vtg 0.9V,VDD as 1.8V and Resistor value as 1k.  
3.Download the library file.  
4.Import the library file to LTspice using spice directive called(.op).
5.Find the cuurent value for the given power rating P=100ÂµW.  
6.Now by doing trial and error method we can find L and W value. Where is L=1u and W=6.85u.  
7.In edit simulation option or command,we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) and Run the Simulation.
