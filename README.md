## **PROCEDURE**:  
1.Design the common source amplfier circuit as per the circuit diagram using LTspice.  
2.Right click on power supply and set gate vtg 0.9V,VDD as 1.8V and Resistor value as 1k.  
3.Download the library file.  
4.Import the library file to LTspice using spice directive called(.op).
5.Find the cuurent value for the given power rating P=100ÂµW.  
6.Now by doing trial and error method we can find L and W value. Where is L=1u and W=6.85u.  
## **DC Analysis**:  
1.In edit simulation option or command,we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) and Run the Simulation.

## **Transient Analyis**:  
1.In edit simulation option,change from dc offset to transient.Set the DC offset as 0.9V,Amplitude 50mV,Frequency 1KHz.  
Set stop time for 1ms and Run the Simulation.

## **AC Analysis**:  
1.In edit simulation option or command,change from transient to Ac anlysis.Set type of sweep as Decade,number of points per decade as 20,start and stop frequency as 0.1Hz and 1THz and Run the Simulation.

# **Calculations**:  
Given the power as 100uW ,we know that Vdd is 1.8V  
from the formula P=VI  
Id=P/V = 100u/1.8 = 55.5uA  
Now,  
from the loop equation : Vdd=IdRd + Vout  
(where Id=55.5uA,Rd=1kohm,Vdd=1.8V)  
Therefore,  
Vout=1.745V  
Hence the Q point = (Vout,Id) = (1.745V,55.5uA)  

## TABULAR COLUMN:  
For DC Analysis,to get thr calculated value of Id,you need to vary the width check for the corresponding Vout.
