## EXPERIMENT - 06 {CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT}  
# Current Mirror 
A current mirror circuit is a fundamental building block in analog electronics used to replicate a reference current with high accuracy.It amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise, making it ideal for high-precision circuits, including operational amplifiers.  

## Classification based on type of moseft used in current mirror circits  
NMOS Currnet Mirroring  
   - Used: N-channel MOSFETs  
   - One NMOS transistor is diode-connected  to set the reference current.  
   - Ensures stable and precise current mirroring.

PMOS current Mirroring
   - Used: P-channel MOSFETs
   - The reference current is set using a diode-connected PMOS transistor, with another PMOS mirroring it.
