## EXPERIMENT - 06 {CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT}  
# Current Mirror 
A current mirror circuit is a fundamental building block in analog electronics used to replicate a reference current with high accuracy.It amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise, making it ideal for high-precision circuits, including operational amplifiers  
### OBJECTIVE
  To design and analyze a current mirror circuit as an active load in a common-source amplifier.
