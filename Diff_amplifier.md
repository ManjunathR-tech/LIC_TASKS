## *Experiment - 03* {Analysis of MOS Differential pair Amplifier}  
**Differential Amplifier** is a circuit that amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals (noise present in both inputs). They are commonly used in operational amplifiers,   comparators, and signal processing applications.  

**There are four types differential amplifier:**   
 Resistively Loaded Differential Amplifier:- The resistively loaded MOSFET differential amplifier is the simplest type of differential amplifier. It consists of two MOSFETs (M1 & M2) operating in saturation mode,a Rss resistor, and also two resistors as load resistances at the drain terminals.
