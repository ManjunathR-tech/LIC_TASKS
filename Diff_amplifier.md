## *Experiment - 03* {Analysis of MOS Differential pair Amplifier}  
**Differential Amplifier** is a circuit that amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals (noise present in both inputs). They are commonly used in operational amplifiers,   comparators, and signal processing applications.  

***There are four types differential amplifier:***   
 Resistively Loaded Differential Amplifier:- The resistively loaded MOSFET differential amplifier is the simplest type of differential amplifier. It consists of two MOSFETs (M1 & M2) operating in saturation mode, Rss resistor, and also two resistors as load resistances at the drain terminals.  
 
 Differential Pair with Current Source:- Replacing the source resistor (ùëÖss) with a current source improves the gain, stability, and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the amplifier.  

 Differential Pair with Single MOSFET Current Source:-A single MOSFET acts as a current source instead of using a current source.This simplifies the design while still improving gain.
