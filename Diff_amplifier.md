## *Experiment - 03* {Analysis of MOS Differential pair Amplifier}  
**Differential Amplifier** is a circuit that amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals (noise present in both inputs). They are commonly used in operational amplifiers,   comparators, and signal processing applications.  
There are four types differential amplifier:
