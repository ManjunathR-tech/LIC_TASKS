## *Experiment - 03* {Analysis of MOS Differential pair Amplifier}  
**Differential Amplifier** is a circuit that amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals (noise present in both inputs). They are commonly used in operational amplifiers,   comparators, and signal processing applications.  

***There are four types differential amplifier:***   
 Resistively Loaded Differential Amplifier:- The resistively loaded MOSFET differential amplifier is the simplest type of differential amplifier. It consists of two MOSFETs (M1 & M2) operating in saturation mode, Rss resistor, and also two resistors as load resistances at the drain terminals.  
 
 Differential Pair with Current Source:- Replacing the source resistor (ùëÖss) with a current source improves the gain, stability, and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the amplifier.  

 Differential Pair with Single MOSFET Current Source:- A single MOSFET acts as a current source instead of using a current source.This simplifies the design while still improving gain.  

Active Load Differential Pair (MOSFET as Load):- Both Iss and Rd are replaced with a mosfet.Gain¬†is very¬†high.  

### *Aim*
  Perform  DC, Transient and AC analysis of differential amplifier with the following specifications using LT Spice simulation software.     

- *Vdd* = 3.2V
- *Vincm* = 1.6V 
- *Power budget* <= 2.8mW 
- *Vocm* = 1.7V 
- *Vp* = 0.6V

With above specifications also extract the following parameters:
- DC operating point
- Input and output maximum swing
- Gain

Above circuit depecits the two common source amplifier having same Vdd connected to a single resistor Rss(Ron3) this constitutes differential amplifier with resistive load.
